# DSA Problems

- Each problem statement is inside its respective folder in README.md file
- The test cases are inside the inputs folder in each problem's folder
- The solution takes input from test_cases.txt files in the inputs folder and output is printed in output.txt files in output folder.
- The solution is written in C++ by me and java code is converted from c++ using ChatGPT
- There are 9 test case files for each problem to judge the quality of code and covers all the edge cases/ boundary conditions and large input cases
- To run the c++ code for all the input execute the `run_test.sh` script in terminal by running the following commands

```sh
chmod +x run_test.sh
```
```sh
./run_test.sh
```

- The output will be obtained in the output folder.
